Agents
======

 - Agent perceives its **environment** therough **sensors** and acting upon that environment through **actuators**. 
 - A **percept** refers to the agent's perceptual inputs at any given instant. 
 - An agent's **percept sequence** is the complete history of everything the agent has ever perceived.
 - A **performance measure** evaluates any given sequence of environment states. It captures the notion of desirability.

Rationality
-----------

What is rational at any given time depends on four things:

 - The performance measure that defines the criterion of success.
 - The agent's prior knowledge of the environment.
 - The actions that the agent can perform.
 - The agent's percept sequence to date.

Hence, the definition of a **rational agent**: *For each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select an action that is expected to maximize its performance measure, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever built-in knowledge the agent has.*

There is a distinction between **omniscience** and **rationality**. An **omniscient** agent knows the actual outcome of its actions and can act accordingly; but omiscience is impossible in reality. Hence a **rational** agent is not necessarily **omniscient**. It can only act based on what it knows and what it has done so far. 

A rational agent should also be **autonomous**. It should learn what it can to compensate for partial or incorrect prior-knowledge. It should also involve itself in **information gathering** and **exploration** with the aim to maximize performance and in order to modify future percepts.

PEAS
----

**P**erformance, **E**nvironment, **A**ctuators, **S**ensors. This helps us specify the task environment. For example, consider a taxi-driver agent:

 - **Performance Measure**: Safe, fast, legal, comfortable trip, maximize profits.
 - **Environment**: Roads, other traffic, pedestrians, customers.
 - **Actuators**: Steering, accelerator, brake, signal, horn, display.
 - **Sensors**: Cameras, sonar, speedometer, GPS, odometer, accelerometer, engine sensors, keyboard.

Properties of Task Environments
-------------------------------

 - **Fully observable** vs. **partially observable**
 - **Single agent** vs. **multi-agent**
 - **Deterministic** vs. **stochastic** (randomly determined; having random probability distribution).
 - **Episodic** vs. **sequential** - In episodic, agent's experience is divided into atomic episoodes. The next episode does not depend on actions taken in previous episodes (e.g. NN classifier for hand-written digits). In sequential, current decision depends on previous actions and can affect future decisions.
 - **Static** vs. **dynamic**
 - **Discrete** vs. **continuous**
 - **Known** vs. **unknown**

Turing Test
-----------

Introduced by Alan Turing in 1950. It is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. A human judge engages in natural-language conversations with a human and a machine. The machine is designed to generate performance indistinguishable from that of a human being. Conversation is limited to a text-only channel. If the judge cannot reliably tell a machine from a human, the machine is said to have passed the test.

Uninformed Search
=================

**Problem formulation** is the process of deciding what actions and states to consider, given a goal. 

A **problem** can be defined formally by five components:

 - The **initial state** that the agent starts in.
 - A description of the possible **actions** available to the agent. Given a particular state `s`, `ACTIONS(s)` returns the set of actions that can be executed in `s`, i.e., each of these actions is **applicable** in `s`. 
 - A **transition model**, which is s description of what each action does. This is specified by a function `RESULT(s, a)` that returns the state that results from performing action `a` in state `s`. The term **successor** is used to refer to any state reachable from a given state by a single action. Together, the initial state, actions, and transition model implicitly define the **state space** of the problem. 
 - The **goal test**, which determines whether a given state is a goal state. 

Framing a search problem
------------------------

There are **six** components: **states**, **initial state**, **actions**, **transition model**, **goal test**, and **path cost**. Provide a mathematical description of the **transition model**, and **goal test** if possible.

Infrastructure for search algorithms
------------------------------------

For each node `n`, we have a structure that contains four components:

 - `n.STATE`: the state in the state space to which the node corresponds.
 - `n.PARENT`: the node in the search tree that generated this node.
 - `n.ACTION`: the action that was applied to the parent that generated this node (i.e., what action from the parent got me here?)
 - `n.PATH-COST`: the cost, traditionally denoted by `g(n)`, of the path from the initial state to the node, as indicated by the parent pointers.

Measuring problem-solving performance
-------------------------------------

 - **Completeness**: Is the algorithm guaranteed to find a solution when there is one?
 - **Optimality**: Does the strategy find the optimal solution? (**optimal solution**: the **solution** that has the lowest path-cost among all solutions).
 - **Time complexity**: How long does it take to find a solution?
 - **Space complexity**: How much memory is needed to perform the search?

Complexity is represented in terms of three quantities:

 - `b`: The **bgranching factor**, or maximum number of successors of any node.
 - `d`: The **depth** of the *shallowest* goal node.
 - `m`: The **maximum length** of any path in the state space. 

Comparing uninformed-search strategies

(+ is actually supposed to be \*.)

Evaluation of tree-search strategies. *b* is the branching factor; *d* is the depth of the shallowest solution; *m* is the maximum depth of the search tree; *l* is the depth limit. Superscript caveats are as follows: <sup>a</sup> complete if *b* is finite; <sup>b</sup> complete if step costs >= ϵ for positive ϵ. <sup>c</sup> optimal if step costs are all identical; <sup>d</sup> if both directions use breadth-first search. 

BFS (Breadth-first search)
--------------------------

A simple strategy in which root node is expanded first and then all successors of the root node are expanded next, then *their* successors, and so on. In general, all nodes are expanded at a given depth in the search tree, before any nodes at the next level are expanded. This means that the *shallowest* unexpanded node is chosen for expansion. To do this we use a FIFO queue (i.e., regular queue). **The goal test is applied to each node when it is generated rather than when it is selected for expansion**; this is because if we applied the test when it is selected for expansion, we would have to expand the whole layer of nodes at depth *d* before the goal was detected, which makes the runtime complexity *O(b<sup>d + 1</dup>)*. The algorithm discards any new path to a state already in the frontier or explored set (any such much must be *at least as deep* as the one already found). Hence BFS always has the *shallowest* path to every node on the frontier.

 - **Completeness**: BFS is complete. If the shallowest goal-node is at some finite-depth *d*, BFS will eventually find it after generating all shallower-nodes (provided branching-factor *b* is finite). 
 - **Optimality**: BFS is optimal, assuming that the path-cost is a non-decreasing function of the depth of the node. This is easily seen if all actions have the same cost. 
 - **Time**: We generate *b<sup>h</sup>* nodes at each level *h*. So the root generates *b*, and then each of those generate *b*, which leads to *b<sup>2</sup>* at the second level, and so on. Hence in general, we have *O(b<sup>d</sup>)*.
 - **Space**: We store every expanded node in the *explored* set. This means that every node remains in memory, which gives us *O(b<sup>d - 1</sup>)* in the *explored* set. The *frontier* set then has *O(b<sup>d</sup>)* nodes. This means that the size of the *frontier* dominates, which gives us a space complexity of *O(b<sup>d</sup>)*.

**Memory requirements are a bigger problem for BFS than execution time.** That is, we will face the issue of running out of memory, long before the face the issue of waiting way too long for a solution. 

Uniform-cost search
-------------------

When all step costs are equal, BFS is optimal because it always expands the *shallowest* unexpanded node. How about an algorithm that is optimal with any step-cost function? 

 - Instead of expanding the shallowest node, **uniform-cost search** expands the node *n* with the **lowest path-cost `g(n)`**
 - This is done by storing the frontier **as a priority queue** ordered by `g`. 
 - The goal test is applied to a node when it is *selected for expansion* rather than when it is first *generated* (i.e., opposite of BFS). This is because the first goal-node that is *generated* may not necessarily be on the most-optimal path.
 - Another test is also added to check for the case where a better path is found to a node currently on the frontier. 

An example:

```

The problem is to get from **Sibiu** to **Bucharest**. The successors of **Sibiu** are **Riminicu Vilcea** and **Fagaras** with path-costs `80` and `99` respectively. Since **Riminicu Vilcea** is the least-cost node, it is expanded next, which gives us **Pitesti** with a total path-cost of `80 + 97 = 177`. Now **Fagaras** is the least-cost node, and so it is expanded, giving us **Bucharest** with a cost of `99 + 211 = 310`. Now also **Bucharest** is the goal node, we keep going since we don't perform the goal test on *generated* nodes. So we will next choose **Pitesti** for expansion which adds a second path to **Bucharest** with the cost `80 + 97 + 101 = 278`. The algorithm now checks to see if this new path is better than the old one; it is and so the old one is discarded. **Bucharest** with `g`-cost `278` is now selected for expansion and then returned as a solution (because we perform the goal test when a node is selected for expansion). 

 - **Optimality**: Uniform-cost search is optimal in gneral. Whenever it selects a node `n` for expansion, the optinal path to that node as been found. Why is this? Assume there exists another frontier node `n'` on the optimal path from the start node to `n`. By definition, `n'` would have a lower `g`-cost than `n` and would have been selected first. Since step-costs are non-negative, paths will never get shorter as nodes are added. 
 - **Completeness**: Uniform-cost search is complete, assuming that the branching-factor *b* is finite, and that the step costs are >= ϵ where ϵ is some small positive-number. If the second assumption does not hold, it can get stuck in an infinite loop if there is a path with an infinite sequence of zero-cost actions (i.e., a sequence of *NoOp* actions). Completeness is therefore guaranteed provided the cost of every step exceeds some small positive-constant ϵ.
 - **Time** and **Space**: The algorithm is guided by path costs rather than depth and so the runtime and space complexity cannot really be expressed in terms of *b* and *d*. Instead, let *C*<sup>\*</sup> be the cost of the optimal solution, and assume that every action costs *at least* ϵ. Then the worst-case time and space complexity is *O(b*<sup>*1+⌊C*<sup>\*</sup>*/ϵ⌋*</sup>*)*, which can be much greater than *b<sup>d</sup>*. Here we're first looking at the cost per step, and then the branching-factor is raised to that power. We add `1` because we apply the goal test when we *select nodes for expansion*. The reason we can have runtime and space complexity greater than *b<sup>d</sup>* is because the algorithm can explore large tree of small steps because exploring paths that involve large, and perhaps useful steps. When all step costs are equal, uniform-cost search is similar to BFS except that BFS stops as soon as it generates a goal whereas uniform-cost examines all nodes at the goal's depth to see if any have a lower cost. Hence, uniform-cost search does more work by expanding nodes at depth *d* unnecessarily.

DFS
---

This search algorithm always expands the *deepest* node in the current frontier of the search tree. The search goes to the deepest level of the search tree, where the nodes have no successors. As those nodes are expanded, they are removed from the frontier, so then the search "backs up" to the next deepest node that still has unexplored successors. Uses a stack (LIFO queue). This means the most-recently-generated node is selected for expansion. 

 - **Completeness**: The graph-search version (which avoids repeated states and redundant paths) is complete in finite state-spaces because it will eventually expand every node. The tree-search version is **not complete**; it can keep following a loop forever. The DFS tree-search algorithm can be modified at no extra memory-cost so that it checks new states against those on the path from the root to the current node. This avoids infinite loops in finite state-spaces but does not avoid the issue of redundant paths. In infinite state-spaces, both versions fail if an infinite non-goal path is encountered (e.g., Knuth's 4 problem; DFS will keep applying the same operator over and over again). 
 - **Optimality**: Both versions are non-optimal for similar reasons. Assuming we have a search space where we have a goal node `C` on the right-subtree at some depth `d`, and a goal node `J` on the left subtree at some depth `d'` (`d' > d`). Then DFS will start by exploring the left subtree even though `C` is a goal node. Further, it would end up returning `J` as a solution even though `C` is a better solution. Hence DFS is not optimal. 
 - **Time**: The time complexity for DFS graph-search is bounded by the size of the state-space (which could be infinite). A DFS tree-search however, may end up generating all of the *O(b<sup>m</sup>)* nodes in the search tree, where *m* is the maximum depth of any node (so this can be much bigger than the size of the state space). Also, *m* itself can be much larger than *d*, and is infinite if the tree is unbounded. For an example, consider a binary tree where the goal node is the deepest and right-most node. In this case, DFS will generate *all* nodes before it gets to the goal node. Even if the goal node is at depth *d* which is much smaller than *m*, the time-complexity is still dominated by the fact that it is still exploring all the other nodes, and hence we still end up with *O(b<sup>m</sup>)*.
 - **Space**: The space complexity is the reason we consider DFS. There is no advantage for a graph search, but in a DFS tree search, we only need to store a single path from the root to a leaf node, along with any remaining, unexpanded sibling-nodes for each node in the path. Once a node has been fully expanded, it can be removed from memory as soon as all of its descendants have been fully explored. Hence, the storage is only *O(bm)* for a state space with branching-factor *b* and maximum depth *m*. 

Depth-limited DFS
-----------------

DFS fails in infinite search-spaces. This failure can be alleviated by using a variation called depth-limited DFS. In this algorithm, DFS is supplied with a predetermined depth-limit *l*. This means that nodes at depth *l* are treated as if they have no successors. This solves the infinite path problem. However, we have an additional source of incompleteness if we chose *l* < *d* (i.e., the shallowest goal is beyond the depth limit. This usually happens when *d* is unknown). Depth-limited DFS is also nonoptimal if we chose *l* > *d* (for reasons of nonoptimality in DFS in general). 

 - **Completeness**: Incomplete if *l* < *d* (but also incomplete in general).
 - **Optimality**: Nonoptimal when *l* > *d*.
 - **Time**: *O(b<sup>l</sup>)*.
 - **Space**: *O(bl)*.

ID-DFS
------

This is a general strategy used in combination with DFS tree search that finds the best depth limit. The algorithm does this by gradually increasing the depth (first 0, then 1, then 2, and so on) until a node is found. This occurs when the depth limit reaches *d*, the depth of the shallowest goal-node. Iterative deepening combines the benefits of DFS and BFS.

 - **Completeness**: It is complete if *b* is finite.
 - **Optimal**: It is optimal if all step-costs are identical. 
 - **Time**: *O(b<sup>d</sup>)*.
 - **Space**: *O(bd)*.

This can seem wasteful because states are generated multiple times. But it turns out this is not too costly, this is because in a search tree with the same (or nearly the same) branching factor at each level, most of the nodes are in the bottom level and so it does not matter that the upper levels are geenerated multiple times. In an ID-DFS, the nodes at depth *d* are generated once, the ones are depth *d - 1* are generated twice, and so on. Hence we have:

N(IDS) = (d)b + (d - 1)b<sup>2</sup> + ... + (1)b<sup>d</sup>, which is *O(b<sup>d</sup>)*.

There is an extra cost of generating the upper levels multiple times, but it is not too large. For example, with *b* set to `10` and *d* set to `5`, we have:

N(IDS) = 50 + 400 + 3,000 + 20,000 + 100,000 = 123,450
N(BFS) = 10 + 100 + 1,000 + 10,000 + 100,000 = 111,110

**In general, ID-DFS is the preferred uninformed-search method when the search space is large and the depth of the solution is not known.**

Informed Search
===============

An informed-search strategy is one that uses problem-specific knowledge beyond the defintion of the problem itself. It can find solutions more efficiently than can an uninformed strategy.

The general approach that we consider is called **best-first search**. This is an instance of the generall `TREE-SEARCH` or `GRAPH-SEARCH` algorithm in which a node is selected for expansion based on an *evaluation function* `f(n)`. The evaluation function is construed as a cost estimate, a node with the *lowest* evaluation is expanded first. The implementation of best-first search is similar to uniform-cost search except we use `f` instead of `g` to order the priority queue.

**The choice of `f` determines the search strategy.** Most best-first algorithms include as a component of `f`, a **heuristic function**, denoted as `h(n)`:

 - `h(n)`: estimated cost of the cheapest path from the state at node `n` to a goal state.

Although `h(n)` takes a node as input, it depends on the *state* at that node. This is unlike `g(n)`, which returns the path cost from the root to node `n`. If `n` is a goal node, `h(n) = 0`. 

Greedy Best-First Search
------------------------

Here `f(n) = h(n)`.

 - **Optimality**: It is not optimal, and to see why, consider a path A-B-C and A-C. The heuristic cost from A-B is 50, the cost from B-C is 100, and the cost from A-C is 100. Greedy best-first search will choose B for expansion because 50 is lesser than 100. However, the path from A to C via B is 50 more than the path from A to C directly. Hence it is not optimal. 
 - **Completeness**: It is incomplete in a finite state-space like DFS. Consider the the same situation above, but with the difference that there is no path from B-C. Then in the tree-search version, B is repeatedly expanded the path from A to C will never be taken. (infinite loop). The graph-search version *is* complete in finite spaces, but not in infinite ones.
 - **Time** and **space**: The worst-case complexity for tree-search version is *O(b<sup>m</sup>)*, where *m* is the maximum depth of the search space. 

A\* search
----------

Here `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`.

Since `g(n)` is the path cost from start node to node `n`, and `h(n)` is the estimated cost of the cheapest path from `n` to the goal, we have:

`f(n)` = estimated cost of the cheapest solution **through** `n`.

The algorithm is identical to uniform-cost search except it uses `g + h` instead of `g`.

A\* has conditions for optimality. These are **admissibility** and **consistency**.

The first condition required for optimality is that `h(n)` is an **admissible heuristic**:

**Admissible Heuristic**: A heuristic that *never overestimates* the cost to reach the goal. This means that `f(n)` also never overestimates the true cost of a solution along the current path through `n`. Admissible heuristics are optimistic by nature because they think the cost of the solving the problem is less than it actually is (e.g.: straight-line distance).

**Consistent Heuristic**: This is a stronger condition that is required only for applications of A\* to graph search. A heuristic `h(n)` is consistent if, for every node `n` and every successor `n'` of `n` generated by any action`a`, the esimated coast of reaching the goal from `n` (i.e., `h(n)`) is no greater than the step cost of getting to `n'` (`c(n, a, n')`) plus the estimated cost of reaching the goal from `n'` (`h(n')`):

`h(n) <= c(n, a, n') + h(n')`

This is a form of the general **triangle inequality**. 

**Optimality of A**\*: The tree-search version of A\* is optimal if `h(n)` is admissible, while the graph-search version is optimal if `h(n)` is consistent. 

How is A\* optimal? First, *if `h(n)` is consistent, then the values of `f(n)` along any path are nondecreasing.* The proof follows directly from the definition of consistency. Supposed `n'` is a successor of `n`; then `g(n`) = g(n) + c(n, a, n')` for some action `a` and we have:

```
f(n') = g(n') + h(n')
      = g(n) + c(n, a, n') + h(n') >= g(n) + h(n)
                                   >= f(n)
```

The next thing we have to prove is that *whenever A*\* *selects a node `n` for expansion, the optimal path to that node has been found.* If this was not the case, it means that there would have to be another frontier node `n'` on the optimal path from the start node to `n`. Since `f` is nondecreasing along any path, `n'` would have a lower `f`-cost than `n` and would have been selected first. Hence a node like `n'` cannot exist. 

Heuristic Development
---------------------

Heuristic accuracy has an effect on performance. The quality of a heuristic is measured by the **effective branching factor** *b*<sup>\*</sup>. If the total number of nodes generated by A\* for any particular problem is *N* and the solution depth is *d*, then *b*<sup>\*</sup> is the branching factor that a uniform tree of depth *d* would have to have in order to contain *N* + 1 nodes. Hence:

*N* + 1 = 1 + *b*<sup>\*</sup> + (*b*<sup>\*</sup>)<sup>2</sup> + ... + (*b*<sup>\*</sup>)<sup>d</sup>

For example, if A\* finds a solution at depth 5 using 52 nodes, the effective branching-factor is 1.92.

It is therefore desirable to generate good heuristics. There are multiple ways to do it:

 - **Relaxed problems**: The heuristics *h<sub>1</sub>* (misplaced tiles) and *h<sub>2</sub>* (Manhattan distance) are fairly-good heuristics for the 8-puzzle problem? Looking at them closely, they are perfectly-accurate path-lengths for *simplified* versions of the puzzle. For the first one, the rule is changed so that a tile could move anywhere instead of just to the adjacent empty square. Then, *h<sub>1</sub>* gives us the exact number of steps in the shortest solution. If we changed the rule further such that we could the tile one square in any direction, even to an occupied square, then *h<sub>2</sub>* gives us the exact number of steps in the shortest solution. A problem with fewer restrictions on its actions is called a **relaxed problem**. This makes the state-space for the relaxed problem a *supergraph* of the original state-space, because the removal of restrictions creates additional edges (i.e., there are more ways we can transition from one state to another since restrictions are removed). Any optimal solution in the original problem is, by definition, also a solution in the relaxed problem; but the relaxed problem may have *better* solutions if the added edges provide short-cuts. Hence, *the cost of an optimal solution to a relaxed problem, is an admissible heuristic for the original problem* (since it can *never* overestimate). Also, since the derived heuristic is an exact cost for the relaxed problem, it must obey the triangle inequality and is therefore **consistent**. 
 - **`ABSOLVER`**: It can generate heuristics automatically from problem definitions, using the "relaxed problem" method and various other techniques (Prieditis, 1993).
 - **Pattern databases**: Admissible heuristics can be derived from the solution cost of a **subproblem** of a given problem. The cost of an optimal solution of a subproblem is definitely a lower-bound on the cost of the complete problem. Hence it is an admissible heuristic. The idea behind **pattern databases** is to store these exact solution-costs for every-possible subproblem-instance. We can compute an admissible heuristic *h<sub>DB</sub>* for each complete state encountered during a search, simply by looking up the corresponding subproblem configuration in the database. The database itself is constructed by searching back from the goal and recording the cost of each new pattern encountered; the expense of this search is amortized over mnay subsequent problem instances. 
 - **Learning heuristics from experience**: We can solve lots of problems and each optimal solution provides examples from which we can learn *h(n)*. Another way is use **featuers** of a state that are relevant to predicting the state's value rather than the raw state-description. For example, we can generate 100 random 8-puzzle configurations and gather statistics on their actual solution-costs. For example, assume we have a feature called "number of misplaced tiles", that is *x<sub>1</sub>(n)*. We might find that when this value is 5, the average solution cost is around 14 and so on. A second feature *x<sub>2</sub>(n)* would be "number of pairs of adjacent tiles that are not adjacent in the goal state". These features can then be combined to generate an *h(n)*. A common approach is to use linear combination: *h(n) = c<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub>(n) + c<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub>(n)*. The constants are adjusted to get the best fit to the actual data on solution costs. The heuristic will satisfy the condition that *h(n) = 0* for goal states, but **is not necessarily admissible or consistent**.

What happens if one fails to get a single, "clearly-best" heuristic from the ones generated? What if a collection of admissible heuristics is available such that none of them dominates any of the others? We can have the best of both worlds by doing:

*h(n)* = max{*h<sub>1</sub>(n)*, ..., *h<sub>m</sub>(n)*}

Local Search
============

In many problems, path to the goal is irrelevant (e.g., 8 queens problem). What we usually care about is the final solution. Hence, we don't need to store the path to the solution, but can simply explore the solution space to either maximize/minimize the objective function (depending on whether we are maximizing payoff or minimizing cost). 

Hill-climbing search
--------------------

This is a simple search algorithm that simply loops and moves in the direction of increasing value (uphill). It will terminate when it reaches a peak (i.e., a point where none of the neighbors have a higher value). This algorithm is also known as **greedy local search**. Unfortunately, hill climbing will get stuck for the following reasons:

 - **Local maxima**
 - **Ridges** (sequence of local maxima that is very difficult for greedy algorithms to navigate)
 - **Plateaux** (flat area).

There are variations to get around these difficulties:

 - **Stochastic hill climing** chooses at random from among the uphill moves; the probability of selection can vary with the steepness of the uphill move. This usually converges more slowly than steepest ascent, but in some state landscapes, it finds better solutions.
 - **First-choice hill climbing** implements stochastic hill-climbing by generating successors randomly until one is generated that is better than the current state. This is a good strategy when when a state has many (e.g., thousands) of successors.
 - **Random-restart hill climbing**: The above algorithms are incomplete; they often fail to find a goal when one exists because they can get stuck on a local maxima. In random-restart, we conduct a series of hill-climbing searches from randomly-generated initial states until a goal is found.

Simulated annealing
-------------------

The regular hill-climbing algorithm *never* meaks "downhill" moves towards states with a lower value (or higher cost). Hence, it is guaranteed to be incomplete. A purely-random walk would allow us to move both uphill and downhill, but is very inefficient. How could we combine the two? We can do this with **simulated annealing**. The innermost loop of the simulated-annealing algorithm is quite similar to hill climbing, except instead of choosing the *best* move, it chooses a *random* move. If the move improves the situation, it is always accepted. Otherwise (i.e., if the move is "bad"), the algorithm accepts the move with some probability less than 1. The probability decreases exponentially with the "badness" of the move (i.e., the amount of Δ*E* by which the evaluation is worsened), and also decreases as the "temperature" *T* goes down. This means that "bad" moves are more likely to be allowed at the start when *T* is high, and they become more unlikely as *T* decreases. If the *schedule* lowers *T* slowly enough, the algorithm will find a global optimum with probability approaching 1.

Local beam search
-----------------

The **local beam search** algorithm keeps track of *k* states rather than just one state. It begins with *k* randomly-generated states. At each step, all successors of all *k* states are generated. If any one of those is a goal, the algorithm halts. Otherwise, it selects the *k* best successors from the complete list and repeats. This may look like we are simply running *k* random restarts in parallel. However, in random-restart each search process runs independently of the others. *In a local beam-search, useful information is passed among the parallel search-threads*. This means the algorithm abandons unfruitful searches and moves towards the area where most progress is being made.

Adversarial Search
==================

Algorithms that cover **competitive** environments in which the agents' goals are in conflict.

MINIMAX algorithm
-----------------

Assume there are two players MAX and MIN. MAX always chooses a move that maximizes the payoff, whereas MIN will always choose a move that will minimize MAX's payoff. So here the strategy is built up assuming that each player plays optimally. Given a game tree, the optimal strategy can be determined from the **minimax value** of each node, which is written as `MINIMAX(n)`. 

```
MINIMAX(s) = UTILITY(s) if TERMINAL-TEST(s)
           = max(a in Actions(s)) MINIMAX(RESULT(s, a)) if PLAYER(s) = MAX
           = min(a in Actions(s)) MINIMAX(RESULT(s, a)) if PLAYER(s) = MIN
```

The **minimax algorithm** computes the minimax decision from the current state. It uses a simple, recursive computation of minimax values of each successor state, directly implementing the defining equations. The recursion proceeds all the way down to the leaves of the tree, and then the minimax values are **backed up** through the tree as the recursion unwinds. 

Assume the following tree:

![minimax](http://imgur.com/sXrSXr5)

The recursion proceeds all the way to three bottom-left nodes, and here it uses the `UTILITY` function on them to discover that their values are 3, 12, and 8. Since the level above is where MIN would play, it takes the minimum of the three values and returns it as the backed-up value of node B. A similar process gives the backed-up values for nodes C and D. Since the root is where MAX plays, we take the maximum of the values, which gives us 3, which also ends up being the backed-up value of the root node.

The minimax algorithm performs a complete depth-first exploration of the game tree. If the maximum depth of the tree is *m* and there are *b* legal moves at each point, then the time complexity of the minimax algorithm is *O(b<sup>m</sup>)*. The space complexity is *O(bm)* for an algorithm that generates all actions at once, or *O(m)* for an algorithm that generates them one at a time.

Alpha-Beta Pruning
------------------

With minimax search, the number of game states it has to examine is exponential in the depth of the tree. We cannot eliminate the exponent, but we can cut it in half by **pruning**. The idea is that we can compute the correct minimax decision without looking at every node in the game tree. The general principle is this: consider a node *n* somewhere in the tree, such that the player has a chance of moving to that node. If the player has a better choice *m* either at the parent of node *n*, or at any choice point further up, then *n* will never be reached in actual play. So once we have found out enough about *n* (by examining some of its descendants) to reach this conclusion, we can prune it. 

The algorithm gets its name from the following two parameters that describe the bounds on the backed-up values that appear anywhere along the path:

 - α = the value of the best (i.e., highest-value) choice we have found so far at any choice point along the path for MAX.
 - β = the value of the best (i.e., lowest-value) choice we have found so far at any choice point along the path for MIN.

To see it in action, consider this tree:

```
                     A
                   / | \
                  /  |  \
                 /   |   \
                /    |    \
               /     |     \
              /      |      \
             /       |       \
            B        C        D
           /|\      /|\      /|\
          / | \    / | \    / | \
         /  |  \  /  |  \  /  |  \        
        11  9 13 7   5 14 2  10   3
```

First we will go all the way down the left sub-tree to find 11, which is initially the lowest-value at B (MIN). On examining other nodes, we find that 9 is actually the lowest value. So B goes through the following value changes:

 - B: [-∞, 11] -> [-∞, 9] -> [9, 9]

Since the MIN value at B is 9, we know that A (MAX) can currently choose a value that is at least 9. So we end up with the following values:

 - A: [9, +∞]
 - B: [9, 9]

Now we will walk through the next subtree. Here, we first find 7. So the values are:

 - A: [9, +∞]
 - B: [9, 9]
 - C: [-∞, 7]

If we explore any more of C's children, they can only have values that are lesser than equal to 7, because MIN at C will choose the smallest value. This means that we will never get a value that is higher than 7. We also know that MAX chooses the highest value. The option that MAX has at A is 9, so it will **never** choose C! This means that we don't have to explore any other nodes under C.

Now we will explore D. Here, we first find 2. So the values are:

 - A: [9, +∞]
 - B: [9, 9]
 - C: [-∞, 7]
 - D: [-∞, 2]

For the same reasons as in the case of C, MAX will never pick D because 2 is smaller than its best choice of 9. This means that we don't have to explore any of D's other children either. Hence, we finally end up with A: [9, 9] which means we play 9. 

Let's also see it in action with the tree rotated:

```
                     A
                   / | \
                  /  |  \
                 /   |   \
                /    |    \
               /     |     \
              /      |      \
             /       |       \
            B        C        D
           /|\      /|\      /|\
          / | \    / | \    / | \
         /  |  \  /  |  \  /  |  \        
        3  10  2 14  5  7 13  11 9
```

First we will go all the way down the left sub-tree. B ends up going through the following value changes:

 - B: [-∞, 3] -> [-∞, 2] -> [2, 2]

Since the MIN value at B is 2, we know that A (MAX) can only choose a value that is at least 2. So we end up with the following values:

 - A: [2, +∞]
 - B: [2, 2]

Now we will walk through C's subtree. Here we first find 14. This is better than the current best-choice of 2, so we have the following values:

 - A: [2, 14]
 - B: [2, 2]
 - C: [-∞, 14]

We then find 5 and 7 under C, which means we end up with the following:

 - A: [2, 14] -> [2, 5]
 - B: [2, 2]
 - C: [-∞, 14] -> [-∞, 5] -> [5, 5]

Now we look at D:

 - A: [2, 5] -> [2, 13] -> [2, 11] -> [2, 9] -> [9, 9]
 - B: [2, 2]
 - C: [5, 5]
 - D: [-∞, 13] -> [-∞, 11] -> [-∞, 9] -> [9, 9]

So we play 9. What is interesting is that the rotated tree forced us to examine every-single node, which means we pretty much ended up with minimax.
